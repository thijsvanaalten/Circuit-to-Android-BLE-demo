# Example 1 - Single Circuit Connection  

## About
StretchSense is a global supplier of soft and stretchy sensors. These sensors are perfect for measuring the complex movements of people and soft objects.

### Background
The StretchSense Android API has been developed to demonstrate how to establish a connection between a StretchSense Fabric Evaluation circuit and a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)  enabled Android device. This platform was developed using android Studio 2.1.2 in Java with a gradle defaultConfig minSdkVersion 19 and a targetSdkVersion 22. 

### Usage
The single circuit connection application demonstrates how to use the StretchSense BLE Android library by stepping through the connection process by way of a list of button elements tied to core library functions.
Buttons:
StartScanning: Start scanning for a new sensor for 20 seconds.
The red label at the bottom of the screen displays the connection status of the sensor.
